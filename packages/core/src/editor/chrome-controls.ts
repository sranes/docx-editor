// Legacy editor chrome, expressed as data (interactive-paginated-editing M6V.1).
//
// M6V.1 reproduces the complete user-visible legacy chrome from archaeology ref
// 9bb06c38f43c0dc297e3de8b5b488b241e134be1 on the greenfield demos. Everything
// here is PRESENTATION ONLY: icon geometry, grouping, ordering, and i18n keys.
// There is no ProseMirror, no legacy painter, no DOM-selection authority, and no
// adapter-owned geometry — a control's enabled state comes from `Editor.can` and
// nothing else.
//
// It lives in engine-editor rather than in either adapter because React and Vue
// MUST render the same chrome. The repo rule is that platform-agnostic logic
// belongs in the shared layer and is called by both adapters, not duplicated; a
// previous round of this change grew 24 React-only exports precisely by ignoring
// that, and no test caught it until a full-repo export-parity sweep.
//
// Icon paths are the Material Symbols set the legacy UI already bundled, lifted
// verbatim (viewBox "0 -960 960 960"). They were extracted programmatically from
// the reference commit rather than retyped, because a hand-copied path is a silent
// visual regression that no assertion would catch.
//
// SLOT IDS ARE THE STABLE PUBLIC CONTRACT.
//
// Every control is addressed as `${groupId}.${controlId}` — `text.bold`,
// `font.family`, `alignment.left`. These slot ids are the vocabulary a host uses
// to place, replace, or hide chrome (Radix-style composition), and the key
// `commandForSlot` resolves to an engine command. They are literal-typed
// (`ChromeSlotId`) so a typo is a compile error, and they are PUBLIC API FOREVER:
// renaming a group or control id is a breaking change. Control ids are unique
// within their group, not globally — `image.insert` and `table.insert` coexist —
// so anything keyed on a control (test ids, icon registries) must key on the
// SLOT id, never the bare control id.
