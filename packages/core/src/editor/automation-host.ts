// Automation over an editor that is already open.
//
// This is an ADAPTER, not a second host: it builds the neutral lane's port over the live
// session and hands it to the same composition factory the headless host uses. Every
// operation, every validation and every read is the neutral lane's, so a document operation
// cannot mean one thing here and another on a server.
//
// Three things it deliberately does not do:
//
// - It owns no document. Authority is the session's canonical package, reached per call, and
//   never the painted DOM. Writes go through `applyTreeOps`, which is one
//   `TreePackageStore.transact` — the same path a keystroke takes — so the surface repaints
//   from the commit like any other, and undo sees one unit per batch.
// - It does not widen the adapter contract. It takes the core editor instance a host already
//   has; the seven-member React/Vue `DocxEditorRef` is untouched.
// - It does not own the editor's lifetime. `dispose()` releases this host's subscription and
//   nothing else: the editor it borrowed keeps working.
//
// Detach and destroy are ordinary states here rather than errors. A detached editor has no
// session, so operations answer `document-unavailable` — the host may well answer again after
// the next `attach`.
