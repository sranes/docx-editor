// The seam between a host and whatever owns the document.
//
// INTERNAL. Not part of the public automation surface: a consumer gets a host, never a port.
// It exists so the headless host and the browser host differ in exactly one place — who owns
// the canonical package — and share every read, every validation and every batch rule.
//
// The port is deliberately the smallest thing that can carry a document: the canonical
// package to read, one ordered-ops transaction to write, bytes to save, and a change signal.
// Note what is NOT here — no per-paragraph read, no text accessor, no offset arithmetic.
// Those live above the port so both hosts cannot answer the same question two ways, which is
// the failure mode a second host implementation always ends in.
