// The typed operation vocabulary.
//
// Each operation reads one canonical package snapshot or becomes `TreeDocOp`s committed
// through the single transaction path. Nothing in between exists: there is no "read after write in the same batch", because a batch is one
// atomic transaction and a query that answered post-commit state would describe a document
// nobody had published yet.
//
// ADDRESSING IS ONE VOCABULARY: a stable paragraph handle plus a UTF-16 model offset
// (`AutomationEndpoint`). A position may also be given as a story EDGE — the start or the end
// of a body — because an object model that wants "append to the document" would otherwise have
// to list every paragraph first just to find the last one, and the host already knows.
//
// WHERE A HANDLE IS RESOLVED matters for what a command can answer. A read names objects that
// already exist, so its answer is available while the batch is being planned. A command that
// CREATES a paragraph cannot name it in advance — the canonical node does not exist yet — so
// those operations answer after the commit, from the state they made. See `plan.ts`.
