// The collaboration-expressibility contract.
//
// Every authorable action a single session can perform — every `TreeDocOp` kind, and every
// member of the accepted property, wrap, and content-control vocabularies — MUST replicate.
// Collaboration replays a canonical primitive journal onto peers, so "replicates" means: the
// action's journal captures deterministically and replays to a convergent replica. The gate
// that proves it is `canonical-primitive-journal-coverage.test.ts`, which requires a
// replay-convergence fixture for every kind AND every variant.
//
// This registry is the ONE escape hatch. An action that genuinely cannot be expressed as a
// journal — a purely local, non-replicable op — is declared here with a reason, and the gate
// accepts a declared reason IN PLACE OF a fixture. Nothing else passes: an action with
// neither a fixture nor an entry here fails the gate. That is the forcing function. An agent
// adding a feature must either prove it replicates or record, here, why it does not — the
// decision is explicit and reviewed, never silent.
//
// Removing an entry is how a later change promotes an action to replicable: delete the line,
// add the fixture. Adding one is a deliberate, reviewable admission that a capability does
// not cross the collaboration boundary yet.
